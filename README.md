# **Watch List**

### **Introduction**

## **User Experience**

### **Agile Development**
From the initial planning and wireframing to building the front and back end functionalities, Watch List was created using the agile approach. I used a GitHub project to build a Kanban board to help visualise the user stories from ‘Todo’ to ‘In Progress’ to ‘Done’. User stories that could not be completed were put into ‘Out of Scope’.

### **Wireframes**

### **User Stories**
User & Site Admin:

1. As a user / site admin I can view the watch list so that I can see what shows / films the admin is intending to watch.
2. As a user / site admin I can view comments so that I can read peoples thoughts on the show / film.
3. As a user / site admin I can add comments so that I can be involved in conversations about the show / films.
4. As a user / site admin I can view paginated list of things to watch so that I can easily look through the list.
5. As a user / site admin I can view recommended shows / films so that I can see which shows / films are the most popular.

User only:

6. As a user I can see more details on the show / film so that I can make an informed decision on whether to watch it.
7. As a user I can register and account so that I can comment and use the recommend button.
8. As a user I can click the recommend button so that I can interact with the content and help others find something to watch.

Site Admin only:

9. As a site admin I can approve comments before they are posted to the website so that I can ensure there are no spoilers
10. As a site admin I can create, read, update and delete content so that I can manage the list.
11. As a site admin I can mark shows / films as watched so that I can keep the list current.


## **5 Planes of User Experience** 

### **Strategy Plane**

### **Surface Plane**
#### **Colours:**
A colour pallet was created using Colour. The main colours used throughout the project are #000000 and #E50914 as these symbolise a cinema chairs which are shown in the background image.

#### **Icons:**
Font Awesome was used for the icons on the page. The add is symbolised by a plus sign, directions symbolised with arrows, the delete button with a trash can and the edit button by an edit icon. The use of these icons ensure the buttons look cleaner and a sale feature was used with the hover effect so users know they can interact with it.


### **Database Models**
The Media model was created after building a relationship diagram to better understand and visualise the database. The Comment and RecommendBox was built further along in the project with help from the Media relationship diagram.
### **CRUD Functionalities**
CRUD functionalities was integral to this project. It was considered throughout the design process and was fulfilled with add, edit and delete buttons and the media list. These are explained in more detail in the features section.

Create: The site admin can create a new media to add to the watch list.

Read: Anyone can read through the watch list and media details.

Update: The site admin can edit existing media listings.

Delete: Only the site admin can delete media listings.
